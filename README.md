# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to provide data driven insight to a company to help maximize sales and profit.

## Process
Step 1 - Data Normalization and cleaning
Step 2 - Aggregation of data by countries, cities, products and product categories, to drive insight.

## Results
From the analysis, the USA is a strong market for this company and drives a huge percentage of the company's revenue.

## Challenges 
Lots of missing values in the database and the different tables are not already connected with private and foreign keys.

## Future Goals
Recommendations for further analysis and research would be traffic sources that led viewers to the site in the first place as well as analysis of age range of customers who made the purchases.
